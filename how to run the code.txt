HOW TO RUN THE CODE-
--------------------

1) The main menu pops after compiling the code, with seven options with a number assigned to every module.

2) We have to select option 1. ie login page to register as a bidder. There are four bidders with teams rcb kkr csk srh respectively.
Once the player has created an account we can move forward to the next module

3) option 2. is for viewing players list and by selecting the player we can view its statistics.

4) This module(3.) is the AUCTION system where the bidders get to bid and make a team .There are total of 24 players and auction takes place as per the rules.
The highest bidder gets the player and once the money is over for a bidder,he cnnot take part in the auction.The players are added in the queue having its team name

5) In this module(4.) the auctioneers can login with their user id and view their teams

6) this module no 5. will view all teams with their team names and the list of players that were stored in the queue

7)This is the final module(6.) that will create the fixtures(schedule) of the matches along with their venues and time.
We then select the winners of each game (or select option no "3" int that module for draw) for all12 games .This generates the points assigned 
to each team(2points for winneing and 1 point for each team in case of draw). Then a points table is formed which shows the teams along with its points 
in decreasing order.

8)To exit the code.
